# Summary
*Age pyramids are a compact and widely used visualizations of demographic variables. They provide a compact view of how a population is By means of three population trees I show how demographic structure  of the titanic desaster differs among victims and survivors of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd class.*

## Pre-Survey
I began with building population trees with excel *("quick-and-dirty-approach")* with the aim to proof whether this kind of visualization is understandbable. I was not sure if the reader knows the concept of age pyramids (although it is a widely used diagram type in Germany). To eliminate education bias, I asked people without college degree. Table 1 shows the results:


| No   | Age | Sex | Education                 | *What do you see here?* | 
| :--: |:---:| :--:| :-------------:| :--:| :--:|
| 1    | 74  | m   | lower secundary education | *I'm not sure, but it looks like an age pyramid. (..) Red is for women and blue is men? What's the light color for?* | 
| 2    | 61  | f   | lower secundary education | *I don't know. (..) The left scale is age (..) It shows age classes for men and women -  A What is 1st class?* | 
| 3    | 17  | m   | high school| *I know this from school. It's an age pyramid. Red is woman, blue is man? You know that normaly man are left and woman are on the right.*| 


I concluded that people are able to identify the age structure. The y-axis should be mirrored (with male on the left and female on the right as this seems to be standard). Victims and survivors should be double coded (e.g. with additional pie charts).
